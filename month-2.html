          Ok so at the day of the SOSA a lot of things were said, most of them are thank you's and accomplishments to faculty, and I was surprised to hear some of my teachers are actually new but i really shouldn't because they look so young.
          The beginning of the speech was about the faculty thanking him for the great things Sir Erwin has done and his excellent decision making abilities that has helped the school in many ways.
          The next part of the speech included the promotions of old faculty and many of the names are very familiar. Another part of the speech was Sir Erwin thanked the faculty for helping the students achieve their goals.
          One part of the speech that confuses me is how he mentions that we need to speak tagalog but the problem with this is we aim to be recognized as an international school and this seems counter intuitive, One
          reason why he said this is because there are a lot of students from other regions but I can tell that the weakness of my classmates is english because according to sir Lowe he has a story
          where the student assistant had difficulties understanding foreign classmates speaking english.

        so nothing in this week was too special and since it was so boring i decided to match the theme and make this entry design look boring too. This week when I search the internet 
        to look for things that can be used in this journal or to help me visualize one, something snapped and I realize that a good leader leads by example rather than just word itself.
        Let me phrase this so you can understand me, if a leader just told you what to do and doesn't help on the task on hand it can be pretty demoralizing and you would probably
        think the leader is lazy and doesn't know anything. True leadership, in contrast, involves not only guiding and directing but also actively demonstrating a commitment to the
         shared goals and tasks, inspiring and motivating the team by setting a compelling example.

        <div class="week-six-text">During this week I heard a lot of the word "vision" and I think to myself, vision: why do people always emphasize this? is it really that important
          and after a bit of pondering and searching in the internet I found a story in reddit about a leader without a vision, the story was about a general. in essence the general fought many battles with his army but with no vision other than "destroy the enemy" he was mindlessly doing battles that have little to no sense put into them
          and the goal of "destroying the enemy" looks more like a fantasy because he doesn't have the vision on how he would do such a thing.

          So this week me and my friends decided to help each other with our websites and this reminds me that a leader is a good friends but they are not afraid to critize the people he or she 
          is working with because what a leader wants is to make everyone in the team improve
