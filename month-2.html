      Ok so at the day of the SOSA a lot of things were said, most of them are thank you's and accomplishments to faculty, and I was surprised to hear some of my teachers are actually new.
      The beginning of the speech was about the faculty thanking him for the great things Sir Erwin has done and his excellent decision making abilities that has helped the school in many ways.
      The next part of the speech included the promotions of old faculty and many of the names are very familiar. Another part of the speech thanked the faculty for helping the students achieve their goals.
      One part of the speech that confuses me is how he mentions that we need to speak tagalog but the problem with this is we aim to be recognized as an international school and this seems counter intuitive, One
      reason why he said this is because there are a lot of students from other regions but I can tell that the weakness of my classmates is english because according to sir Lowe he has a story
      where the student assistant had difficulties understanding foreign classmates speaking english.
