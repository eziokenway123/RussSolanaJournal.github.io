      Hello! My name is Russ Ricci Sola&#241a. 
      I am 19 years old and my birthday is September 17,2003. 
      My hobbies are playing video games, chess, and coding(html and css). 
      I am an only child and my life motto

      I am preparing my chess openings and my strategies and i just realized that chess and leaders have a lot in common.
      Both the leader and chess players need to coordinate their team or pieces in order to achieve their goals. Both needs to assess
      the risk in their operations and ensure that it doesn't compromise the overall goal. And both needs to adapt to whatever the situation
      throws at them otherwise they will fail.

      <p class="week-two-description">The significant week has arrived! I am both filled with excitement and nerves as I anticipate the tournament. I'm optimistic that my dedicated training will prove to be worthwhile. The weight of expectations rests on me, as my batch anticipates me securing the top spot in the tourney. The first game presented a formidable challenge; I encountered defeat. However, a stroke of luck came my way as the tournament was declared as double elimination. I am hopeful that the upcoming game will fare much better.

      I managed to secure victory in the subsequent game. Triumph followed suit in the game after that. My opponents, the ardents and exemplars, were vanquished. Yet, the next match promises to be a formidable hurdle, given that it involves the Marvels, who bested me previously. Nonetheless, by another stroke of luck, I triumphed, employing a shrewd tactic.
      
        The suspense has reached a crescendo. Both my next opponent, the guardians, and I are poised to compete. The most daunting part is that a single loss marks the end of the journey, while victory requires conquering my adversary twice. The first game concluded in a draw, which worked in my favor, granting me the chance to play as white. As a result, I seized victory!
      
      Due to the lateness of the hour and our mutual fatigue, we opted to postpone the game until Thursday. The awaited day finally arrived, with a best-of-three showdown. Fully prepared and eagerly awaiting the decisive moment, I held my ground. At last, the tournament's outcome was determinedâ€”I was crowned the champion. A sense of happiness enveloped me, knowing that the arduous struggle had culminated in a triumphant comeback.
    </p>

    <p class="week-two-description">
      The championship has been a valuable learning experience for me, offering insights that resonate with leadership. Similar to how I was tasked with securing the first place, leaders often find themselves in a comparable position, with their team relying on them to guide them toward achieving their goals.

      Furthermore, just as I confronted a formidable adversary, leaders must possess the ability to navigate competition, seeking ways to gain an advantage over rivals. Additionally, despite being on the verge of elimination, my tenacity and resilience was shown. My loyal chess pieces mirrored my motivation to persist, even when the situation appeared hopeless.

      In essence, the championship has mirrored leadership principles, shedding light on the expectations, competitive spirit, and unyielding determination that contribute to success.

      So it was a boring week to be honest. a lot of studying and nervousness because the exam is next week so as a way to relax my body I decided to watch some youtube, I was scrolling 
      and then I found an interesting video from Epic History called "Belisarius and the wars of Justinian". It was really interesting how such a young man became a prominent general and 
      from what I learned he was a very unfortunate generals because despite his amazing leadership and strategic mind he was not given riches and fame, he was even treated poorly because
      luck was not on his side but I digress. The thing that makes me realize that he is an excellent leader is because of two things: He was excellent at resource management and he commanded
      with loyalty
