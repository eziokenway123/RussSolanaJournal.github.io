        This week I found a youtube video about Hannibal barca. Hannibal's unwavering dedication to his homeland and his refusal to give up, even when faced with overwhelming odds, make him an inspirational figure. 
        His determination to make things better for Carthage is a testament to the power of leadership and strategy in the face of adversity. and this is why this week is dedicated to home because
        a true leader never gives up even when times looks grim.

            While watching Gordon Ramsay, I noticed that he is an active listener, and he is not afraid to contribute his ideas to solve the problems the team is facing. I admire this quality in him. It showed me that a good leader is an active listener who is willing to hear what the team has to say.

            In most of my entries I have been talking about motivating the people in the team. I had never said how so in this week I decided to study what should I do to motivate people.
            Acknowledging their efforts, setting clear goals, providing opportunities for growth, and offering recognition for their achievements are good ways i have found in the internet.

            While watching the Ambassador of Goodwill, I noticed that everyone exudes confidence, and it led me to think that good leaders are not only confident in their abilities but also in their team. Confidence, both in oneself and in the team, is a hallmark of effective leadership.

            If I were to choose a Filipino dish to represent my leadership style, it would be Bicol Express. I describe my leadership style as fiery, and the spiciness of this dish perfectly mirrors that intensity. I strongly believe in fostering community unity, much like how Bicol Express is considered a communal dish where people come together to savor its flavors. The diverse ingredients in the dish also symbolize how I collaborate with others, blending unique talents and perspectives to achieve common goals.
